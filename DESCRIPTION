Description: Compute price indices using various Hedonic and
    multilateral methods, including Laspeyres, Paasche, Fisher, and HMTS (Hedonic
    Multilateral Time series re-estimation with splicing). The central function
    calculate_price_index() offers a unified interface for running these methods
    on structured datasets. This package is designed to support index construction
    workflows for real estate and other domains where quality-adjusted price
    comparisons over time are essential. The development of this package was funded
    by Eurostat and Statistics Netherlands (CBS), and carried out by Statistics Netherlands.
    The HMTS method implemented here is described in Ishaak, Ouwehand and Rem√∏y (2024)
